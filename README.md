# Open Hospital - GUI
[![Java CI](https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-gui/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)](https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-gui/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Java+CI+with+Maven%22)

This is the GUI component of [Open Hospital][openhospital]: it contains a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Java Swing.  
This project depends on the [Core component][openhospital-core] for the business logic and the data abstraction layer.  
An alternative user interface based on React and currently still work-in-progress is available [here][openhospital-ui].

## How to build

To build this project you'll need Java JDK 8+ and Maven. 
Additionally, you'll need to build and install locally the [Core component][openhospital-core] of Open Hospital.
Once you do that, to build this project just issue:

    mvn package
    
To run the tests simply issue:

    mvn test
    
## How to launch Open Hospital

To launch Open Hospital GUI, use the scripts `startup.sh` (on Linux) or `startup.cmd` (on Windows).  
You will need a MySQL database running locally (e.g. the Docker container available in the Core project),
or any similar SQL database. Before running the application, you should change 
`rsc/database.properties` accordingly.

For futher information, please refer to the Admin and User manuals in the [Doc project][openhospital-doc].

## Code style

This project uses a consistent code style and provides definitions for use in both IntelliJ and Eclipse IDEs.

<details><summary>IntelliJ IDEA instructions</summary>

For IntelliJ IDEA the process for importing the code style is:

* Select *Settings* in the *File* menu
* Select *Editor*
* Select *Code Style*
* Expand the menu item and select *Java*
* Go to *Scheme* at the top, click on the setting button by the side of the drop-down list
* Select *Import Scheme*
* Select *IntelliJ IDE code style XML*
* Navigate to the location of the file which relative to the project root is:  `.ide-settings/idea/OpenHospital-code-style-configuration.xml`
* Select *OK* 
* At this point the code style is stored as part of the IDE and is used for **all** projects opened in the editor.  To restrict the settings to just this project again select the setting button by the side of the *Scheme* list and select *Copy to Project...*. If successful a notice appears in the window that reads: *For current project*.

* Select the *Import...* button
* Navigate to the location of the file which relative to the project root is:  `.ide-settings/eclipse/OpenHospital-Java-CodeStyle-Formatter.xml`
* Select *Open*
* At this point the code style is stored and is applicable to all projects opened in the IDE.  To restrict the settings just to this project select *Configure Project Specific Settings...* in the upper right.  In the next dialog select the *openhospital* repository and select *OK*.  In the next dialog select the *Enable project specific settings* checkbox.  Finally select *Apply and Close*.
* Back in the *Code Style* menu area, select *Organize Imports*
